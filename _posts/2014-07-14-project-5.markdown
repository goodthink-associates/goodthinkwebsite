**Goodthink Associates** retains experts active in the trading sector for three decades. Specific areas of expertise include the following:

- Buying and selling physical commodities such as construction materials, foodstuffs and automotive products.

-  Trying to anticipate trends as well as to arbitrage opportunities.

-  Working to secure a supply of raw materials for a business or industry, to help create liquidity in international markets and/or to invest speculatively.

-  We have traded goods as diverse as cocoa, coffee, cereals, sugar, oil, natural gas and precious metals. The company has a particular specialism in related services: shipping and logistics, inspection and certification, insurance and trade finance.

-  Margins are often relatively slim yet these are compensated by the relatively high volumes transacted: absolute revenues are a direct function of the volume.
