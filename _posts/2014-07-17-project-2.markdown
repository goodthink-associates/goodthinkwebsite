**Goodthink Associates** retains experts active in the identification of exceptional investment opportunities who then establish collective schemes enabling access for investors.

-   **_Exempt Trusts_**: We are specialists in exempt unit trusts (‘EUTs’) and exempt property unit trusts (‘EPUTs’). These apply to tax-exempt investors such as those with a self-invested personal pension (‘SIPP’), or a small self-administered scheme (‘SSAS’).

-   **_Non-Exempt Investments_**: iSIPPs or SSASs enable those on pension schemes to own assets and place these in a range of approved investments.

-   **_Pension Schemes_**: We can organise and/or act as the trustee, operator, manager or general partner of an EUT, EPUT or LLP.

Goodthink Associates has extensive contacts with all the right professionals – in terms of cost and flexibility – to create investment structures, including lawyers, auditors and fund managers. In a highly regulated sector, we offer a one-stop shop for investors to coordinate the whole process.
